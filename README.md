# Spots

## Use Case

BlocSpot will play an active role in helping you discover and navigate the world around you. Contrary to on-demand location discovery which requires active participation (Yelp, Google Maps, etc.), BlocSpot will alert you when you're near places of interest even when the app is closed.

At any given moment, there are dozens if not hundreds of restaurants, museums, bars, beaches and theaters users would like to check out. Wouldn't it be great if they could save these for later and have their phone notify me them when they approached one?
